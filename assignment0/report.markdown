### 1. Installing

* We started by getting an account to ozzy and getting comfortable with ozzy and tmux.
* We found a PLASMA installer at [PLASMA](http://www.netlib.org/plasma/), simply the installer there.
* We created the directories HOME and plasma_local.
* We used the command 
```
[]$ ./setup.py --cc=gcc --fc=gfortran --blaslib="/usr/lib/libblas.a"
--lapacklib="/usr/lib/lapack/liblapack.a
```
to install PLASMA.
* We realized that the tests did run directly after the install, but they take very long time. Therefore we interrupted it and then run the tests for themselfs.


### 2. Testing

When installing PLASMA, the test files run automatically unless the --notesting flag is used. We noticed however that the tests took a while to run, so we did them separatly from the install.

To do so we navigated to "/HOME/plasma_local/plasma-installer_2.8.0/build/plasma_2.8.0/testing" and entered
```
[]$ ./plasma_testing.py -c 56
```
The -c flag let's us enter the number of cores we wanna use for the tests (figured out by using -h), and when using 56 it took about 31min. If the installation script starts the testing it will run on 2 cores and this takes quite a long time.

### 3. Makefile

When we look in the Makefile in the testing directory, we start by noticing that the all target has the dependency EXE, where EXE is a variable declared to ztesting, ctesting, dtesting and stesting. Taking ztesting as an example, it is dependent on one header file testing_zmain.h and a bunch of object files declared in the ZOBJ variable. These object files are in turn dependent on the same header file and corresponding source files, which can be seen in the target/dependency statement `testing_z%.o: testing_z%.c testing_zmain`. The c-, d- and stesting files are made in the same way, the only difference being that their source file variables are declared in the included Makefile.src and the ztesting files in the main Makefile. All the target/dependency statements also have links to libraries whose variables are declared in the included file Makefile.internal. This file sets all the common variables used by all make files in the plasma project (stated in the description of the file). It also includes make.inc which is a file that is automatically generated by the plasma installer and contains the options for compiler and the paths to the libraries set when running the installer.
