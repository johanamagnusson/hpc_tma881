1. LAPack and PLASMA
2. Installing

First, I don't know how detailed this should be, so maybe I overwritten it.

* First, we simply got an account to Ozzy
* We got used to ssh, since I've actually never had any use for it before. I also tried to get a little familiar with tmux.
* We found my PLASMA installer at [PLASMA](http://www.netlib.org/plasma/), simply the installer there.
* We sended the file to ozzy
* We created the directory HOME and plasma_local.


3. Testing
4. Makefile
