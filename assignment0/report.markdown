1. LAPack and PLASMA
2. Installing

First, I don't know how detailed this should be, so maybe I overwritten it.

* Firstly, I simply got an accopunt to Ozzy
* I got used to ssh, since I've actually never had any use for it before. I also tried to get a little familiar with tmux.
* I found my PLASMA installer at [link](http://www.netlib.org/plasma/), simply the installer there.
* I sended the file to ozzy
* I created the directory HOME and plasma_local.


3. Testing
4. Makefile
